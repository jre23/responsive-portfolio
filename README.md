# Responsive Portfolio

## Description

The goal for this project was to create a mobile responsive portfolio using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. Each .html contains information about me and are linked to each other via the navbar. The contact page has my contact info and a form for general inquiries. The portfolio page has links to some of my projects!
