## Description

The goal for this project was to create a mobile responsive portfolio using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. Each .html contains information about me and are linked to each other via the navbar. The contact page has my contact info, a form for general inquiries, and a fun giphy image to look at! The portfolio page has links to some of my projects!
