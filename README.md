## Description

The goal for this project was to create a mobile responsive portfolio using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. A set of images were provided as a guide for how the design should look like at different screen widths. The minimum requirements were as follows:

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.
